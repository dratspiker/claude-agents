## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

1. **Identify your productivity pain points** (information overflow, repetitive tasks, tool fragmentation)
2. **Choose the appropriate subagent** based on your specific workflow needs
3. **Describe your current tools** and systems for context
4. **Share examples** of typical content or tasks you need to process
5. **Specify your preferences** for automation complexity and maintenance requirements

Each subagent provides:
- Deep expertise in their respective domains
- Understanding of productivity principles and best practices
- Focus on sustainable, low-maintenance solutions
- Support for ADHD-friendly and neurodivergent-friendly workflows
- Integration strategies across multiple platforms and tools

## ðŸ“š Productivity Best Practices

### PKM System Design:
- **Capture everywhere:** Minimize friction for information input
- **Process regularly:** Establish routines for organizing and acting on captured information
- **Review systematically:** Build review cycles to maintain system health
- **Start simple:** Begin with basic structures and evolve as needed
- **Trust the system:** Develop confidence in your organization methods

### Automation Development:
- **Identify patterns:** Look for repetitive tasks that can be automated
- **Start small:** Build simple automations and gradually increase complexity
- **Test thoroughly:** Ensure automations handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- **Document well:** Create clear instructions for setup and maintenance
- **Iterate frequently:** Refine automations based on actual usage patterns

### Tool Integration:
- **Choose core tools:** Limit the number of primary productivity tools
- **Define boundaries:** Establish clear rules for what goes where
- **Build bridges:** Create connections between tools to reduce friction
- **Maintain consistency:** Use similar organization patterns across platforms
- **Regular maintenance:** Schedule time for system cleanup and optimization
