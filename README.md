## ‚ö° Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured
- Git for cloning the repository

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone the agents collection to your Claude Code directory
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agents.git

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

The agents are automatically available once placed in the `~/.claude/agents/` directory.

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Automatic Agent Invocation
Claude Code intelligently selects the appropriate agent based on context:

```bash
# Automatically invokes api-designer
"Design a REST API for user authentication with OAuth2"

# Automatically invokes python-pro  
"Optimize this Python data processing pipeline"

# Automatically invokes devops-troubleshooter
"Production database is experiencing high connection timeouts"
```

### Explicit Agent Invocation
Request specific agents for targeted expertise:

```bash
# Code quality and security
"Use security-auditor to scan for OWASP vulnerabilities"
"Have code-reviewer analyze this component for best practices"

# Development tasks
"Get backend-architect to design microservice boundaries"
"Use frontend-developer to create responsive dashboard layouts"

# Infrastructure operations
"Have devops-troubleshooter analyze these production logs"
"Get kubernetes-architect to optimize cluster resource usage"

# Business and marketing
"Use business-analyst to create quarterly performance metrics"
"Have seo-content-writer optimize this blog post for search"
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
Agents collaborate seamlessly on complex tasks:

```bash
# Feature development pipeline

## üèÜ Best Practices

### üéØ Effective Agent Usage
1. **Trust automatic delegation** - Let Claude Code select optimal agents based on context
2. **Be specific with requirements** - Include tech stack, constraints, and quality criteria
3. **Leverage agent expertise** - Each agent is optimized for their specific domain

### üîÑ Multi-Agent Orchestration  
4. **Start with high-level requests** - Allow agents to coordinate complex multi-step workflows
5. **Provide rich context** - Ensure agents have necessary background information
6. **Review integration points** - Verify how different agents' outputs work together

### üéõÔ∏è Advanced Control
7. **Use explicit invocation strategically** - When you need specific expert perspectives
8. **Combine complementary agents** - Different specialists can validate each other's work
9. **Request cross-functional reviews** - "Have security-auditor review backend-architect's design"

### üìà Optimization
10. **Monitor workflow patterns** - Learn which agent combinations work best for your use cases
11. **Iterate on complex tasks** - Use agent feedback to refine requirements
12. **Match complexity to capability** - Leverage appropriate agent sophistication levels

## ü§ù Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Workflows
```
User Request ‚Üí Agent A ‚Üí Agent B ‚Üí Agent C ‚Üí Integrated Result

Example: "Build secure payment processing"
payment-integration ‚Üí security-auditor ‚Üí test-automator ‚Üí deployment-engineer
```

### Parallel Execution  
```
User Request ‚Üí Agent A + Agent B (simultaneously) ‚Üí Merged Results

Example: "Optimize full-stack application performance"
performance-engineer + database-optimizer + frontend-developer ‚Üí Combined optimizations
```

### Conditional Routing
```
User Request ‚Üí Analysis Agent ‚Üí Route to Appropriate Specialists

Example: "Fix production bug"
debugger ‚Üí Routes to: backend-architect OR frontend-developer OR devops-troubleshooter
```

### Review & Validation
```
Primary Agent ‚Üí Review Agent ‚Üí Quality Assurance ‚Üí Final Delivery

Example: "Implement new API feature"
api-designer ‚Üí code-reviewer ‚Üí security-auditor ‚Üí Validated implementation
```

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: agent-name
   description: Clear description of when this agent should be invoked
   model: haiku  # Optional: haiku/sonnet/opus based on complexity
   tools: tool1, tool2  # Optional: specify required tools
   ---
   
   System prompt defining the agent's expertise and capabilities...
   ```

### Contribution Guidelines
1. **Quality First** - Ensure agents provide real value and expertise

3. **Test Thoroughly** - Verify agents work correctly in various scenarios
4. **Follow Conventions** - Maintain consistency with existing agents

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b new-agent-feature`)
3. Add your agent with proper documentation
4. Test the agent in various scenarios
5. Submit a pull request with detailed description

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent Not Automatically Selected**
- Ensure your request clearly indicates the domain or task type
- Add more specific context about your technology stack
- Use explicit invocation if automatic selection isn't working

**Unexpected Agent Selection**
- Provide more detailed requirements and constraints
- Specify the type of solution you're looking for
- Use explicit agent names for precise control

**Conflicting Agent Recommendations**
- This is normal - different specialists may have different priorities
- Ask for reconciliation: "Resolve the differences between security-auditor and performance-engineer recommendations"
- Request a unified approach that balances all concerns

**Missing Context Between Agents**
- Provide comprehensive background information in your initial request
- Reference previous conversations and established patterns
- Use context-manager for complex multi-session workflows

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate model assignments for task complexity
- Leverage parallel agent execution for independent tasks
- Optimize agent selection for cost-effectiveness
- Monitor agent performance and adjust usage patterns
